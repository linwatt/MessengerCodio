Create a new Android Studio project for an application named “Messenger” with a package name of *com.hfad.messenger.* 

The minimum SDK should be API 15 so that it will work on most devices. 

You’ll need a blank activity called “CreateMessageActivity” with a layout called “activity_create_message” so that your code matches ours.
