Android Studio has a wizard that lets you add extra activities and layouts to your apps. 
To create the new activity, choose File → New → Activity, and choose the option for Empty Activity.

Give the new activity a name of **“ReceiveMessageActivity”** and the layout a name of **“activity_receive_message”.**
