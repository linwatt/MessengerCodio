Behind the scenes, Android Studio also made a configuration change to the app in a file called **AndroidManifest.xml**

**If you develop Android apps without an IDE, you’ll need to create this file manually.**


All activities need to be declared in AndroidManifest.xml. If an activity isn’t declared in the file, the system won’t know it exists. And if the system doesn’t know it exists, the activity will never run.
